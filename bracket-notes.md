## Notes

- Question: "Who should get a bid?" Answer: Use *results-based* metrics - KPI and SOR. 
- Question: "What seed will they get? Who wins head-to-head?" Answer: Use *predictive* metrics.
- Approx. 500 at-large bids from 2008-2022. Only five at-large teams with NET over 70: All 10 or 11 seeds. 20 at large bids with NET/RPI above 60 
- NET rank in the 60s = Not good enough. Only one at large bid in 2021 or 2022. ([#](https://twitter.com/JohnGasaway/status/1620824438974418952))
